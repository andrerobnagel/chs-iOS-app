chs-iOS-app
===========
The official Columbine iOS app. It allows for quick and easy viewing of staff directories, calendars, schedules, and more. It pulls data from the web and formats it in a native iOS view.

There isn't anything really special about the source code; it can be used for references or examples on how to do certain things. This repository is mainly just a backup of the code, and a way for me to learn about GitHub.

The IDE used was xCode 6, and the minimum iOS version is 7.1.
